## 1st Winterspeak
- Want to find Asara.
  - Looking to study god of wisom, Zavylan.
- North and west is to the coast (and back to where we were on the material plane)
- South and east is forest as far as the eye can see
- Travelled into the forest, came across 4 beasts.
  - They had 4 beady eyes, 2 mandibles and mouths full of webs. They were bipedal and had long lanky arms:<figure><center><figcaption><small>Etticap</figcaption><img src=images/12/etticap.png width="150"></center></figure>
  - During the fight, two more Etticaps appear. We fuck those bois up.
  - After the fight, Simon came out for the first time: <center><img src=images/12/simon.png></center>
- Didn't bring rations. Used survival guide to find out that Etticaps are just general beasts of the Feywild. Preys on Sprites and Pixies.
- Manage to scrap together enough food with the guide to get two rations. Takes an hour.
  - Dwarf berry party.
- Have a sleep. Feel rested. Wake up and it's still twilight, which is very strange. The sky has shifted but no change in daylight.

## 2nd Winterspeak
- Travel SE for about 2 hours. Forest gets thinner, and then we get to a road, going going NE and SW.
  - Colgate flies NE and reports a small little town (literally, small and _little_).
  - Send him SW and tell him to meet us on the road, while we travel NE.
  - He catches up after half hour, couldn't see anything 10-15 mins SW.
  - Walk for about 2 hours. The road goes from 8-10ft wide, narrowing to 1ft wide.
- We hit the small and little town
  - It's _very_ little. The doors are about 15inches high. Most built into the trees.
  - Seems about a medium sized town, but scaled down tiny so you can't tell.
- We hear whispering and laughing that we can't understand.
  - Reldath casts comprehend languages and find the language to be almost musical -- He hears "Aren't they funny? What are they doing here? How did they get here?"
  - With a good arcana check, I gauge there are probably quite a few invisible creatures around.
  - Bartimus uses detect magic to find out these creatures are actually invisible
- Walk to center of the town. As we think of leaving, a 12inch tall, flying creature appears in front of Reldath's face. Think it's a giant butterfly, but it's a 10-12in tall human who is very well dressed.
  - It speaks and says "what is a group of four people such as yourselves doing here?"
  - After some chat we find out they speak Silven
  - He's the high Pixie, welcomed us to Colzieu
  - If we sort out his mushroom cave problem, he'll introduce us to the high Pixie in Feyhall, and let us see his map of the Feywild.
  - Directly South is the cave. About half a day.
  - Introduce myself as Reldath. He introduces himself as Daloran. 
    - Bartimus plays a tune on his drums to Daloran. Several pixies start **fucking vibing**.
- Start travelling South to get to the mushroom cave.
- Received 675 xp.

# Session 13
- Takes us 8 hours to do a 4 hour walk south to the cave
- Try to sneak in the cave, but Thundhrum's billowing cape gave us away ( a 1 (-1) stealth roll!!)
- Reldath casts minor illusion to make an image of Daloran appear, and a huge 4ft rock spanks through the illusion.
- We fight and beat the boi up:<figure><center><figcaption><small>Some sort of giant</figcaption><img src=images/13/giant-thing.png width="150"></center></figure>
- Searching the cave, we find 8g and in a hidey hole Reldath finds 3x glowing mushroom caps
  - Reldath casts identify and finds out they are faintly magical, but he feels that they would allow you to perform a little better, regardless of goal. (Eating 1 gives advantage on next attack role or ability check for 1hr)
- We sleep in the cave, Reldath reads his book and doesn't sleep.

## 3rd Winterspeak
- Bartimus chops off all of the giant's fingers to make crossbow bolts in the future
- Evelda pulled a tusk out of the giant
- Head back to Colzieu, speak to Daloran. We give him the tusk as proof. He lets us copy his map and starts taking us to see the high pixie.
- We play geoguessr on the map to guess where we are.
- He says we must be on our way then, and cracks on.
- He explains how to tell the time in the Feywild:
  - We use this small cluster of 5 yellow stars to tell the time.
    - They form an almost perfect pentagon. They trace across the sky 5 times in a day. The day becomes 5 chunks. Usually between 3.30 & 4.30 we rest & sleep. We wake up at 1.30
    - Once they are out of view, there is another cluster they use to tell the time then. 7 pointed cluster is the "moon".
- Bartimus, from listening to Daloran, thinks he learns some Sylvian: Yes = Fi, No = Von, Please = Si Lah, Thankyou = Mer Tu
  - Daloran thinks Bartimus can speak Sylvan, and asks him why he didn't say
  - Bartimus says Fi, Von, Si Lah, Mer Tu and learns that he does in fact know these words!
- Reldath finds out that Simon is affected by true polymorph.
  - Evelda doesn't seem to mind all that much!
- Thundhrum casts zone of truth and finds out that Simon is, indeed, a good boy

## 4th Winterspeak
- Travel to a huge body of water. Realise it must join the ocean and the canal on the other side. (We reach Fayhall!)
- As we travel, we see sort-of-elves, but can't identify them properly. They have flatter ears and different eye colours. They're doing the bulk of the manual labour. We reach Two Rings and walk to the river's edge.
- We receive 1050 XP.

# Session 14

- On Mistcrown side of city -- North gate is the "manual labor" side of the city. Mistcrow has a far greater number of pixie houses instead of "elf" houses.

## Guest visitor Jenni (Kay)

- Get to the high pixie's halls
  - He says he thinks they speak the language of the Sylvan Elves
    - He says it distastefully
  - The high pixie snaps her fingers, and a sylvan elf appears with dark hair, olive skin, hazel-green eyes, young looking.
- Have a discussion with the high pixie, who trapped us and led us away to our quarters
<figure><center><figcaption><small>The high pixie</figcaption><img src=images/14/high_pixie.png width="250"></center></figure>
- Ran away, found out that Kay has a master.
- Kay doesn't know the name Asara, but knows that Zyvllan is a key deity (but not the major one!). She does know that swamp witches are common in the Fae!
- Found out that the middle island is hotly contested between pixies and sylvan elves -- There's a war going on!
- Decide to travel to the main Zyvillan temple on the West island in Shylalian.
- Start heading back to Colzieu to see if we can get a boat
  - We have a nights rest

## 5th Winterspeak
## 6th Winterspeak
- Spend the day travelling, reach Colzieu near the end of the day
- We walk into the town to gasps and invisible pixies rushing to their homes
- Head to the port, to see if there are any boats
  - The port is quite small, but not tiny. There is one boat that Bartimus and Thundhrum recons they could fit us all on -- They wouldn't take it on the material plane, since they are too rough.
    - The seas are a purple hue. They appear to be very calm and tranquil looking from the dock. Kay and Thundhrum have a discussion and recon that the waters in the Fae are more like still, fresh water from the Material plane
      - Bartimus points out there is no moon, and Thunhdhrum calls him a nerd
- Reldath drinks the water and his skin goes barky
- We get on the boat, and Thundhrum, Bartimus and Kay lead the way in a rough Westerly direction (roughly a straight line)
  - Everyone manages some sleep, but Kay suffers a point of exhaustion :(
- At the end of the day, we get about hald way between the East and West islands (about one square south of the little blob in the middle islands)
- Bartimus sings us a sea shanty. The DM's words were "pretty good". Bartimus keeps the moral high with "the steel drum and the voice combo".

## 7th Winterspeak
- Day of travel at sea; Kay loses her point of exhaustion, and Bartimus and Evelda suffer one point of exhaustion.
- We get to choose where to land, we can make out the three gulfs on the East coast of the West island.
  - We decide to land in the first gulf, as it takes the least time.
- We land in a town, and are met on the port with significant questioning. Who are we? What are we doing here? As soon as the realise we are not Pixie related, they become very helpful.
- We get 425xp!

# Session 15

- We arrived to the town of Yflion
- People are a bit nervous; it's clear that we're strange travellers
- We waste hours searching for an inn -- Bartimus and Thundrhum march us down the residential district
- We reach an inn, called the spoon and ladle
- In the town center, Thundhrum spots a small jewelery shop
- Kay sees some posters:
  - One poster for the Prince's circus, but no instructions
    - Kay shares this with us: The Prince of rain and shine is Kay's master; Kay wasn't aware he was 
  - One poster for the recruitment of the royal army
  - One poster for an amateur dramatics
- We walk in the inn, Kay at the front. She goes in easily, but the inn stops when we enter.
  - He asks the barman about the circus: He says they were heading North about 10 days ago.
  - They start arguing -- He hasn't seen the Prince
  - We sit at a table: They have wine.
  - Kay asks for 3 bottles with a nice suggestion; the bartender gives her three bottles of Immolonean mead
  - Thundhrum clicks his heels and puffs his cloak out and "floats" out the inn at 50ft/sec.
- Cast Tiny Hut exactly 10ft from inn door, so patrons have to squeeze past
  - Reldath reads for 8hrs and gets a point of exhaustion

## 8th Winterspeak
- We prepare a great show for when the hut drops, and we absolutely kill it. Reldath starts a bass beat, Bartimus gives a SICK performance and riffs it, Kay gets on Evelda's shoulders and when the hut drops bigs up the circus, does a flip off of Evelda's shoulders and uses Reldath pop up hat to collect 20g (3d100!!!)
    - The inn keeper looks **pissed** that we got so much applause and no repercussions from the guards
- Kay asks some well-to-do man about a fey witch or someone who would buy giants thumbs
  - The well-to-do man says about hags being near the forest; the outskirts of the woods is a days walk west. (The middle of kingdom of mompoiaria where there are no cities is the woods region)
- We walk west and get to the edge of the woods at the end of the day
- We share our past stories with each other as we camp down for the night with a tiny hut

## 9th Winterspeak
- We walk through into a clearing, where we come across 4 statues
- As we approach a statue, three 10 foot 8 legged lizards jump out at us
<figure><center><figcaption><small>The basilisk fight scene</figcaption><img src=images/15/basilisk-fight-scene.png width="250"></center></figure>
<figure><center><figcaption><small>A basilisk</figcaption><img src=images/15/basilisk.png width="250"></center></figure>

  - One stares at Yevelda and Reldath with its icy blue gaze, and their feet turn to stone
  - We kill them
  - We find a vial with a tiny amount of shiny silver liquid in it, and an urn/jug with a sealed looking top with 10 corks in the top (swishing it around reveals it has liquid in it), there is also 2 more of the spilled silver liquid potion. He was also carrying 43g.
  - Reldath identifies the potion (difficult with such a small sample) -- It is not a potion, it is actually an oil, designed to cover a body and remove a petrify effect.
  - Reldath knows these creatures, they are basilisks.
- We pour the oil over one guy, who has an arm bitten off. Initially it does nothing, but then after 3 or 4 minutes it immediately seeps into the stone and a flesh tone returns in the blink of an eye.
- He comes back and falls to the ground, Thundhrum cures his wounds and he reaches for his sword. He speaks in Sylvan with Kay and tells him its the year 682 of the 4th age (same year as material plane). He starts speaking common and says its barely been a couple of months. We offer him some water & some honey wine
  - He might be able to find a buyer for giant's fingers
  - He's never baked before. He doesn't want to learn
  - He knows a little bit about Zavylan
    - He hasn't heard the name Asara before
  - His name is Fenellis Sunsong
  - He's on his way to Shylalian, he can show us the way if we want
- We spend 20-30 minutes in the forest to the North, but eventually Fenellis finds an egg. Luckily we don't find any more basilisks.
  - He's clearly a woodsman, he recons the eggs will hatch in about 25 days. The nests have been disturbed and moved away from for about 4-5 months, so he's missed his window and can't sell to his buyer.
- He recons his buyers wont pay much for giants fingers, a few gold pieces each maybe.
- We make a tiny hut and rest for the night
  - Reldath takes a point of exhaustion and fully reads the hitch hikers guide to planar travel
    - It becomes a spell book for planar travel (5th level) and plane shift (7th level), which he can learn when he's powerful enough.
## 10th Winterspeak
- We spend the next day and a half travelling, fairly quickly, to Shylalian.
## 11th Winterspeak
- We arrive to Shylalian in the evening.
- In the center of the city is a giant tree, 50-70ft tall, in its center.
  - Kay is a bit like "ugh this again"
  - The rest of us are taken back with the sparkle of the city!
- We get 920xp

# Session 16
- It's a hot day (irl) -- Get the fans out
<figure><center><figcaption><small>What a quiff</figcaption><img src=images/16/quiff.gif width="250"></center></figure>

- Looking around around, Kay and Howl seem to have dissapeared
- Still twilight
- Fenelis suggests not to cut through the south docks, but instead go around, and get to clearhill.
- There is a small gap between every building.
- Fenellis tells us Fargrove is where most of the local traders are.
  - Also spice square, and wetmarket is for trade from the sea
- Fenellis is off to the Winking Otter, just by the north wall of the citadel. Leaves us in Fargrove.
- Thundhrum spots a dark faced shop with tinted windows, lined with lots of potion bottles, and no sign on it
  - Thundhrum says this is it. This is the weird ass shop
- We go in and a see a small sylvan elf (4.5 ft). It's the first one that we've seen that is showing their age. She has thick wrinkles, with off-white gray hair. She has bottle-cap lensed glasses which enlarge her eyes.
  - She explains that hill giants toe hairs has a very high concentration of the element that makes a strength potion. Since the fingers are not that strong, it would make like a 1.5l. We say no thanks!
  - She also tells us that the butternut squash jug is an alchemy jug. It gives you unlimited liquid
    - The red top one was a nice wine
- We go to the temple
  - We see the golden symbol of the tree on some clergymen and clergywomen, so we can see who is looking after the temple
  - The temple is inside the tree, and is beautifully ordained with items made SOLELY from the tree itself
  - We spend about a minute taking it all in, then as we walk in, Thundhrum notices that in the side corridor there was Asara. They make eye contact and Asara turns around a tight corner.
  - We chase her and take the same turn she did. 
  - We reach a t junction and turn left
  - Colgate goes right and reports 3 doors. On the left we note more doors and some stairs. We skip the dorm doors and go upstairs. We send Colgate to the main hall to scout.
  - We get stopped and have a discussion about finding Asara. He was a bit abashed that we were authoritative and said no priest or priestess Asara was here, or was visiting that he was aware of.
  - We get stopped by a priest of high ranking and two towns guards. We convince the priest that we are here because we were told it was our fate. Have a chat with the priest.
