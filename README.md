 - Asked 
 - Asara - Could be conduit between physical and spiritual world.
 - Keep two worlds separated.
 - God teaches that understanding of separation must be reached for you to be enlightened.
 - Does work to prevent gods intervening.
 - Diety of wisdom: He exists in all times and places, past present and future.
   - Awareness balance understanding
   - His work is more of a service to other gods, ensuring they remain on 
- Can infer that Asara is probably a servant of Zavyllan. Although lesser known, most likely has been a champion for quite some time.
