# ZIVILYN
_(Found out in Session 10)_

Zivilyn, also known as the World Tree, Wise One, and the Tree of Life, represents the godly force of wisdom. He encourages the soul to grow by achieving enlightenment and wisdom. Zivilyn’s influence extends to all realms and to all times. He promotes understanding and spiritual awareness. Zivilyn gives counsel to Gilean, bringing wisdom to Chislev as well.

Zivilyn is respected by all Gods, and never chooses sides in a fight or disagreement. Because of this Zivilyn serves a purpose to all gods as a mediator - he often travels freely to the nine hells of baator and even the infinite layers of the abyss moving with immunity because he is there to resolve some quarrel between gods with evil intent.

Zivilyn’s teachings tell us that it is worse, through your own actions, to steer or change another’s fate than it is to avoid living your own. There is a fine line between affecting and trying to influence the fate of those around you and helping them realise it. Ultimate enlightenment is achieved by fulfilling one’s fate, although it is common knowledge that few ever do.

Because of these facts Zivilyn’s influence is subtle, for fear of influencing the actions of mortals one of the few places he never travels to is the material plane. For the few special mortals that he deems need his guidance he instead sends a champion, normally a fae from the feywilds, to introduce those under his watch to their fate. ((No mention is made of Asara however))

Although a traveller, Zivilyn’s home plane is the Olympian Glades of Arborea some say the tree yggdrasil is his home, others still believe that yggdrasil and Zivilyn are one and the same, and it is through the roots of the great tree that he provides his services to all the known planes.
